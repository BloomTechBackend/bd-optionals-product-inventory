Double click on the failed test and you will see the Assertion message detail.

Example:

* `Exception had wrong message ==> expected: <The productID was null> but was: <The productID was nil>`

Below that you will see a call stack. The call stack will include details about where the message is being returned
from. Edit your message to match the expected value.
